 🦠 Vaccination Impact on COVID-19 Fatality Rate in India

📌 Project Overview
This mini project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations on the fatality rate in India using data analysis techniques in Python. The goal is to explore how vaccination progress correlated with the reduction in COVID-19 deaths over time.
We use a real-world dataset containing daily COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination numbers in India. The analysis helps us understand the effectiveness of the vaccination drive in reducing fatalities.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `date`: Date of observation
- `cases`: Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases
- `deaths`: Daily COVID-19 related deaths
- `vaccinations`: Cumulative vaccination count

🔍 Analysis Performed
- Time series visualization of COVID-19 deaths and vaccination rollout
- Correlation analysis between vaccination count and fatality rate
- Comparative graphs before and after vaccination campaigns

📈 Key Insights
- A clear decreasing trend in fatality rate observed as vaccination coverage increased
- Visualization helps confirm the positive impact of vaccinations in saving lives
- The analysis supports the role of large-scale vaccination efforts in pandemic control

📁 File Structure
- `vaccination_Impact_Analysis.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `Vaccinationdata.csv` – Dataset used for the analysis
